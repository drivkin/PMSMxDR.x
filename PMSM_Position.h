 * @brief 	This library provides SVPWM with position control with an LQG
 *
 * This library provides implementation of a 3rd order LQG controller for a PMSM motor with
 * space vector modulated sinusoidal pulse width modulation control of a permenant magnet
 * synchronous motor.
 *
 * The LQG controller has been characterized in closed loop with an ARX model using a noise
 * model to uncorrelate the characterized input from noise.  Supporting MATLAB code can be
 * found in the same repository that this code was found in.
